# CarbonDrive Project 

**CarbonDrive** is a B2B2C platform that transforms eco-driving behavior into digital carbon credits.
We use drivers’ GPS data to prove eco-driving, reward them with **$CDRIVE tokens** via micropayments on Stellar, and create a marketplace where these tokens can be cashed out or sold to companies seeking high-quality offsets.

## Problem

- Companies need to offset CO₂ emissions, but most available credits are **outdated**, **low-credibility**, or **hard to audit**.

- Ride-hailing drivers face **high fuel costs** and receive **no incentives to drive efficiently**.


## Solution

**CarbonDrive** connects drivers, companies, and blockchain in a seamless ecosystem:

**- Drivers rewarded instantly:** Each eco-driving action (like smoother acceleration or fewer harsh brakes) generates a micro-reward, often worth just a few cents.

**- The micropayment challenge:** Traditional banks can’t process millions of $0.05 or $0.10 transactions daily — fees would exceed the payment itself. Most platforms solve this by tracking IOUs in internal databases, which are not real money and lack transparency.

**- Our approach:** On Stellar, every micro-reward is settled directly on-chain. If a driver earns eight cents, our Soroban smart contract mints exactly 8¢ in $CDRIVE tokens to their Stellar wallet, instantly and at near-zero cost.

**- Cash-out made simple:** When drivers accumulate a comfortable balance (e.g., $10), they tap `Cash Out`. **CarbonDrive** aggregates their tokens and sends one PIX transfer in Reais to their bank account — turning thousands of micro-events into one macro-payment.

**- For companies:** The tokens collected from drivers are bundled and sold in bulk as auditable carbon credits, directly addressing corporate ESG and compliance needs.

→ **CarbonDrive** makes micropayments feasible, transparent, and scalable — turning daily driving behavior into a new class of carbon credits. 

→ **CarbonDrive** is fully abstracted for drivers. They don’t need to understand blockchain or tokens — they just drive, see their balance grow, and cash out via PIX. This ease of use dramatically increases adoption, because drivers interact only with a simple app interface, while all the blockchain complexity runs silently in the background.”

## How It Works (Workflow)

**Data Collection** – App captures GPS + accelerometer data.

**Impact Calculation** – Fuel saved → CO₂ avoided.

**Tokenization** – Oracle mints **$CDRIVE** tokens on Stellar.

**Driver Rewards** – Instant micropayments in tokens.

**Cash Out** – Convert tokens to Reais via PIX.

**Corporate Offsets** – Companies purchase aggregated credits.

## Why Stellar?

- **Micropayments at scale:** instant, low-cost, auditable.

- **Transparency:** every credit is on-chain → no double counting.

- **Inclusion:** seamless cash-outs to local payment rails like PIX.

## Vision

- **CarbonDrive** is more than an app — it’s a sustainable ecosystem:

- Drivers save money and earn tokens.

- Companies get high-quality, domestic carbon credits.

- Society benefits from safer driving and reduced emissions.

## Next Steps
- Launch pilot with ride-hailing drivers in São Paulo  
- Add real-time eco-driving scoring in the app  
- Enable PIX cash-out for **$CDRIVE** tokens using an API from a fintech (e.g. Stripe)
- Expand marketplace for corporate carbon credit buyers  
- Explore partnerships with Uber, 99, and BlaBlaCar
