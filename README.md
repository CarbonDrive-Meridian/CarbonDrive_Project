# CarbonDrive Project 

**CarbonDrive** is a B2B2C platform that transforms eco-driving behavior into digital carbon credits.
We use drivers’ GPS data to prove eco-driving, reward them with **$CDRIVE tokens** via micropayments on Stellar, and create a marketplace where these tokens can be cashed out or sold to companies seeking high-quality offsets.

## Problem

- Companies need to offset CO₂ emissions, but most available credits are **outdated**, **low-credibility**, or **hard to audit**.

- Ride-hailing drivers face **high fuel costs** and receive **no incentives to drive efficiently**.


## Solution

**CarbonDrive** connects drivers, companies, and blockchain in a seamless ecosystem:

- Drivers download the app → GPS tracks eco-driving → they earn **$CDRIVE** tokens.

- **Stellar blockchain** settles millions of micro-transactions instantly, at near-zero cost.

- Drivers cash out via PIX, while companies buy credits in bulk to offset emissions.

→ Turning everyday eco-driving into verifiable, blockchain-backed carbon assets.

## How It Works (Workflow)

**Data Collection** – App captures GPS + accelerometer data.

**Impact Calculation** – Fuel saved → CO₂ avoided.

**Tokenization** – Oracle mints **$CDRIVE** tokens on Stellar.

**Driver Rewards** – Instant micropayments in tokens.

**Cash Out** – Convert tokens to Reais via PIX.

**Corporate Offsets** – Companies purchase aggregated credits.

## Why Stellar?

- **Micropayments at scale:** instant, low-cost, auditable.

- **Transparency:** every credit is on-chain → no double counting.

- **Inclusion:** seamless cash-outs to local payment rails like PIX.
